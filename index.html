            An <strong>adorable</strong> duck being used as support pal for
            someone. Can't this convince you to get a duck?

        <h2>Great emotional support!</h2>
        <p>
          I mean c'mon, sure they can't talk but their cuteness and fuzzy layer
          is enough to get you awing for them! That and the fact that their
          annoying honks can keep you distracted from whatever is
          going on in your life. Just don't kill them out of rage!

        <h2>They are just <strong>SO</strong> adorable!</h2>
        <p>
          Nobody, and I mean it, <strong>NOBODY</strong> can deny the cuteness
          of these adorable creatures! Can you get enough of their absolutely
          innocent eyes, their stupendous texture when you put them against your
          face, and their absolute cute waddling?! I'm sure you cant!

        <h2>They make great sources of protein!</h2>
        <p>
          Look, I know that I'm talking about pets here, but I find absolutely
          no reason as to why you shouldn't eat your pets! Look, it may sound
          stupid, but think about it. If you are bored and you need a little
          spice in your life (and maybe your pet duck has been getting pretty
          annoying), just kill and eat it! Ducks provide a great source of
          protein and are absolutely yum!
